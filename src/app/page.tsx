          <p>Hi, I'm Talha Bayansar ðŸ‘‹</p>
          <p>
            I'm a frontend developer with a strong focus on creating elegant and
            efficient user interfaces. I have a deep appreciation for React and
            its ecosystem, and I specialize in leveraging technologies like
            Next.js for robust full-stack development.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can find me on the football field, enjoying
            the beautiful game, or spending quality time with my family. I'm
            happily married, 23 years old, and proud to call Belgium my home,
            with Turkish heritage shaping my cultural background.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm passionate about continuous learning and growth, both personally
            and professionally, and I'm always excited to tackle new challenges
            and contribute positively to projects and teams.
